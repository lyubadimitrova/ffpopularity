When he’d last bumped into Lambert on the border of Temeria they’d ended up in a local tavern, drinking terrible ale and trying to come up with new collective nouns for the sheer number of alghouls they were seeing. A ‘mold’ was for more than ten, a ‘rot’ was for more than 30, and a ‘necrosis’ was for more than 50. Thankfully there were only a couple of graveirs who’d found this village, and he’d been paid to destroy the dead rather than the necrophages themselves. Despite most people realising that fire got rid of them permanently, many had proved reluctant to burn to their loved ones, regardless of the number of maggots they were infested with.

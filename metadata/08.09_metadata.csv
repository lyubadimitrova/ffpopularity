As much as others whom know of their relationship may suggest, they aren't quite ""childhood friends"". It's a little more complicated than that... The Shirasagi family has always been a very wealthy family. Kaoru's case is quite the opposite. Kaoru's family was poor, they were struggling  to live, it was as if they were barely hanging onto their lives. Chisato's father offered Kaoru a job that started from a young age. Kaoru would live under the Shirasagi household as a maid, tending to Chisato, basically raising the young mistress of the Shirasagi family. And to compensate for her work and troubles, the Shirasagi family would make sure that the Seta family could live comfortably. This brings us to the present day. Where many have gotten to know these two as ""the fleeting maid, and the shorted and tempered mistress"" This may end up just being a series of anthologies about a day in the life for those two.

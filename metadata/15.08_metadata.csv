The article said that November 11th was Pocky Day, which was a day to celebrate the Pocky snack in Japan. One way to celebrate was by playing the Pocky Game. The Pocky Game was played with two people, and, of course, a Pocky stick. The players would place the stick between their mouths, and each would take one end of the stick in their mouths, creating a line between them. Then, each player would take turns biting pieces off until they reached the middle, and whoever pulled away first lost.
 
Although, it said that what usually happens is that neither person backs out, resulting in a kiss.

No dialog options countered the arguments presented against it. And in so doing, vast majority of players seemed to fall for not using the artifact being the only moral choice. I don't think I can agree. Yeah, it may be up for debate what was the best course of action during the story... but selling it as one dimensional moral choice with clear bad and clear good side was frustrating for me to experience.So I condensed all arguments I had during the game into one additional dialog I added for Rocket as his last desperate plea to make his case."

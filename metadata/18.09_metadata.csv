 Allen rolled his eyes. “Oh, you- the pronoun. The usual?” He wouldn’t admit that the man’s irritation made him the slightest bit happy. If the smile wasn’t telling enough, that was his own problem.
 
“My name is Kanda, you bean sprout.” And Allen could not even revel in his short victory because of the horrid thing that he was just called.

“Bean sprout. Get your hearing checked.”
 
“Why the hell would you call me a bean sprout?”
 
“Che’ because you’re short. And I pay you to make my coffee. So do your job sprout, I don’t have all day.”
 
“First off, you don’t pay me. Second, wipe that smirk off your face. That was not clever.” It was. “My name is Allen, or was my nametag not big enough for you to see while standing right in front of me?” And then he groaned because the jerk, newly named Kanda, was clearly not paying attention to him. “Dumbass.” He muttered under his breath and graced the man’s cup with Prick. And for extra spite, he only did fourteen pumps each for Kanda’s drink.

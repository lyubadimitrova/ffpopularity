The upshot is that the tower is pretty much empty, especially since Mr. Stark only occasionally leaves his lab for food or a change of clothes. He even sleeps in there, Peter is pretty sure. So Mr. Stark doesn’t seem to notice or care when Peter starts staying in one of the spare bedrooms in the old Avengers tower.
  It’s sort of his room anyway, not in any official capacity but it’s the one he always stayed in after a mission if it was too late at night or he was too bloodied to go back home without freaking May out, which is something he doesn’t like to think about anymore.  Peter feels lost after the battle on Titan.

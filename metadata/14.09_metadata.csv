Dear Newton, 
    I can finally share with you that I have been offered a temporary teaching position at Harvard, covering a professor who is going on sabbatical in the fall. They reached out due to their interest in my preliminary research on the breach; they would like me to give presentations or something of the like. Is this something you would be interested in collaborating on with me? You’ll be very close by, after all, and I hope you want as much as I do to discuss our shared passions in the flesh.    I arrive in Boston early next month. I look forward to spending time with you, if you’re amenable.    Yours,    Hermann   or: ""one of us thinks this is a date but the other thinks it’s an informal job interview (or, in this case, project collaboration proposal)"""

There was Bucky’s problem, Steve realized. “You think that’s what I want after 100 years? Cleaning up your fuckin’ guts off the runway?” He slammed Steve into the wall against and Steve couldn’t deny the fact it turned him on to be pushed around.    They never behaved like this. Sure they were rough but it was mutual. This time, this was Bucky letting out his angst and Steve was ready to take it. It was hot. Really hot actually.    “You knew I had that,” Steve countered with the hint of a smirk. Bucky’s nostrils flared like an angry stud. “What are you gonna do? You gonna punish me, Buck? You gonna bend me over your knee and spank me for almost getting myself killed? Hmm?” He couldn’t help his taunting tone as he stared Bucky down. “Maybe that’s what you should’a done back in the 30′s. Put my frail ass over your knee and beat it til I came. Maybe I would’a learned something.”  _______ Also known as Steve being a reckless jerk and Bucky puts him in his place."

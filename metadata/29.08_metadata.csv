The middle of their tale you already know; a tale of magic and mayhem, of hearts beating as one even across the divide of dimensions. The beginning and end you do not, though it’s fair to assume there was and will be; a journey of a thousand words begins with a letter on a page, and some might say it’s the last word that makes the journey worthwhile. But we are not here to talk of beginnings or endings. We are here to talk of in-betweens. The missing pieces, the stolen seconds, long days and lonesome nights of wishing, waiting, hoping.
  What await you within these pages, dear reader, are but a few of these seconds. Events and non-events, momentous and mundane alike, simple moments that would join these two noble souls forever in love, altered not with brief hours and weeks. Moments that would cement the bonds of the body, the mind, the spirit.  And they begin, as many such moments in the lives of lovers do, with a bed. Panto and Silas; a brief snapshot of what makes them Panto and Silas."

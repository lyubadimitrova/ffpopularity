But when six brave warriors came from out of nowhere to prevent needless bloodshed, their hope had been reborn, fueled by a newfound desire to free their world from evil. As they rebelled against their former masters, they could always turn to these warriors for help, even when times were at their darkest. The rebellion was a success, and Eltarians everywhere would come to honor and remember these heroes for all of the heroic deeds that they had accomplished. Such acts of goodwill would spark the birth of a legacy that would live eternal throughout the universe. This is the story of how Eltar was freed, a tale passed down from one generation to the next.

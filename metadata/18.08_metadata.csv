SEDUCING REILLY by MAUREEN CHILD

The Tempting Mrs Reilly

Brian Reilly was a man on the edge. It had been two long weeks since he and his brothers had made the bet, before Tina Coretti Reilly turned up on his doorstep. And now that his beautiful ex-wife was within arm's reach again, he didn't know how he'd survive! Because Tina wanted a baby. Brian's baby.

Whatever Reilly Wants…

For two years Connor had been coming to Emma Jacobsen's shop, she'd listened to him talk about this woman and that one. She'd thought their friendship was special. Until he admitted how 'safe' and 'comfortable' he felt around her, how he'd laughed at his brother. Well, war was declared! She was going to show her 'pal' just how much of a threat she could be to his chastity!
 This fic uses the chastity challenge, the unlikely suitor winning the prize, and the bonds of brotherhood and family.  Plus Merlin having had it up to here, Eggsy being lovely, Percival being magnificent, and some last-minute romances!"

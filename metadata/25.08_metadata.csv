Sarcasm can be traced back to the Greek verb sarkazein, which initially meant ""to tear flesh like a dog."" Sarkazein eventually developed extended senses of ""to bite one's lips in rage,"" ""to gnash one's teeth,"" and ""to sneer."" The verb led to the Greek noun sarkasmos, (""a sneering or hurtful remark""), iterations of which passed through French and Late Latin before arriving in English as sarcasm in the 17th century. Even today sarcasm is often described as sharp, cutting, or wounding, reminiscent of the original meaning of the Greek verb."""

Privileged,” she adds pointedly with a small grin, teasing. Bellamy can’t stop the responding smile he gives back. “But I didn’t really appreciate him enough,” she continues, her grin turning soft again. “He was always encouraging me. Even things that weren’t going to lead anywhere, that other people might have thought were a waste of time, or resources. Like my drawing.

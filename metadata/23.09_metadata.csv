Peter was surprisingly old fashioned. For years, she’d been the one to buy roses for her office, but now he sent a weekly bouquet. He liked to pick her up from work, liked to open the door for her, liked to guide her by the small of her back when he wasn’t holding her hand or walking with his arm around her. In the past, a partner who held to her like he did would have driven her insane, but she loved how his hand was never far from hers, how whenever they were together, he leaned in to her space. He liked to choose where they ate - though it wasn’t a problem because they liked the same places, dinners were spent sitting next to each other, not across the table, and he always helped her into her chair, and made sure she ordered first. All of it was perfectly romantic, and Murphy would never admit it to the people in her life, but she was thoroughly enchanted with how he made her feel like a lady.

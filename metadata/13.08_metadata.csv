“These trolls will need and crave much gentleness and care and will want and require not only a lovers touch but family touch as well. They will often be incoherent and if alone they can panic and break down, falling into a terrified mindstate. These Trolls need constant supervision during their heat and need to be known that they are loved and cared for. If not surrounded by loved ones it can be detrimental to their health. Contrary to popular belief it does not make them want to jump the nearest person or spread their legs for the nearest rut troll, in fact, if they aren't mated then they won't feel sexually aroused at all, simply needing family care and touch. However, if mated, the troll will have sexual urges that must be met by their mate and only by their mate.
 
Heat trolls are exceedingly rare now and days, whether it is because most have adapted to stay out of that harmful mindset we cannot be sure. However, if you have a heat troll in your family, please do your very best to take care of them.”

The woods nearby are quiet again, no living soul present to witness the outcome of a brutal, animalistic battle that took place between demons just moments before. On the earth’s surface down below, on the ground by a small stream lies a near-dead body of a young man, naked with his left arm torn off and bleeding profusely. He is unconscious, having become too exhausted to keep his head up or his eyes open. It seems that his fate is sealed… or is it? Akira’s eyes open slowly just as his vision is extremely blurry; he feels human consciousness creeping back in. Although blurry, his vision catches sight of a figure, a familiar figure. “Ah, so you’ve woken up!” Akira hears Ryo’s voice, sounding relieved. Akira at first didn’t know how to respond to that. Was his heart still beating, his blood still pumping? “Am I even alive?” was all Akira could muster before closing his eyes and taking a breather. He pauses a moment, trying to get it all together.

Shiro often wakes not long after falling asleep, trembling and muttering in Japanese. He always pulls Matt closer and holds him tighter then too. Sometimes he even hides ins face in the crook of Matt’s neck, and Matt can feel tears against his skin, showing him that Shiro is more affected that he lets on most of the time.
 
It makes Matt feel a little better. To be the one holding them both together in the dark for once. Even if he’s falling to pieces more often than Shiro, it still feels like it balances some invisible scales.

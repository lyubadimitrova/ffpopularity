BLOODSUCKER CLAIMS NEW VICTIM: HEART SURGEON KIDNAPPED ON WEDDING NIGHT
   Local predator Viktor Nikiforov strikes again, but with a daring move that deviates from his modus operandi—to devastatingly scandalous effect. On Saturday night, Dr Katsuki Yuuri, 27, whose medical expertise and excellent bedside manner has earned him a reputation as one of the nation’s top physicians despite his relatively young age, was snatched from the arms of his intended at the Hotel Grande Prix by Nikiforov, who ferociously descended upon Katsuki just before the poor gentleman could say “I do”. After making the menacing pronouncement that he had “come to take what was rightfully his”, Nikiforov once again displayed his vampiric penchant for flamboyant destruction by shattering the champagne tower, and made his dramatic escape by swinging out of the window with the unfortunate bridegroom under his arm. Nobody was harmed at the scene, but armed guards are now patrolling the hotel as a precautionary measure. The whereabouts of Katsuki are currently unknown, but Lord Nishigori Hiroshi, father of the bride Nishigori Yuuko, says that he will go to any lengths to find and secure Katsuki."

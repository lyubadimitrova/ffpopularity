Yoongi thinks this before he switches to a fresh page in his notebook, closing the app and putting his phone away, already zooming in with his mind to the soft skin of the dancerâs neck. Yoongi pictures a flower of some sort, not one in particular, but a plant that just blossoms out, with a long stem that curves. Yoongi thinks with the dancerâs username, a flower wouldnât be too far off. He has such a cheery disposition when heâs like this. He smiles brightly, and sometimes Yoongi catches a small smile heâs sporting in return.  But itâs different when heâs dancing. Depending on the type, he can become serious, cocky, threatening, sexy...and then sometimes Yoongi catches his jaw down on the ground and quickly picks it back up. His mind just continues to work like this, etching out lines, some darker than others, until finally he pulls back to see this intricate design that will probably never go on the person it had been intended for. He tries not to think too hard about that, watching the way the late sun looks on the blooming buds in the distance. OR Tattoo Artist Yoongi finds inspiration in the one dancer that he follows on Instagram."

That problem is his new head pastry chef Yuuri Katsuki. It's not that he's lacking in job performance. No, it's quite the opposite in fact. Victor's problem with Yuuri is he's utterly enamored and can't take his eyes off of him, even when he's supposed to be plating a stunning filet mignon with an equally mouthwatering mushroom and pink peppercorn sauce.  Victor just can't seem to find the courage to ask the tastiest treat to ever walk into his kitchen if he would like to go out on a date. Maybe Yuuri can beat Chef Nikiforov to the punch."

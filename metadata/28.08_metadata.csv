So I was going through one of my emails and found a draft reply to someone that was titled Wicked Blood Chapter 1. I started looking through it and the story and name sounded familiar but I couldn't remember why I had this in my drafts. I tried emailing the person the draft was meant for but the email (according to Outlook at least) doesn't exist anymore. When I tried looking up the story it doesn't show up anywhere nor does the nickname of the recipient (whom I believe was the author who had asked me for editing help but Idk). So I copy and pasted what was in the email here in hopes that maybe one of my readers can help me track down the author. I suspect that they deleted the fic which is a shame but I just want to make sure everything is ok. Please note that I am not trying to steal this fic, nor am I claiming this as mine. If you know ANYTHING, please let me know in the comments. I will most likely either delete this after I find out what happened or I will make a second chapter to tell everyone what happened to Wicked Blood. Again, if you know ANYTHING, please tell me. If the author simply just wanted to delete their story and start fresh then I will respect their wishes. Thank you. -Lumi"

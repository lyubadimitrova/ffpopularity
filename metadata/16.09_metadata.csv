Like “parents.” Or “boyfriends.” Or “major life changes.”  ….until a man in a leather jacket shows up insisting that she has a twin sister--a delusion she’s long-since buried. Though she manages to dissuade him of the notion, he sticks around, and soon enough she trusts him enough to go with him on an impromptu road trip to a tiny town in Maine she’s never heard of. There she meets a schoolteacher who loves arrows almost as much as she does, a grumpy blonde in a red leather jacket, and a little boy who insists that said blonde is her twin sister, and that the two of them are destined to break a magical curse.  (The curse is...a lot, but there’s one thing she’s learned, in her 28 years of coping with delusions and intrusive thoughts: if someone else is seeing it, you’re probably not crazy.) Things quickly begin to progress as friendships are formed and secrets unravel. Will Storybrooke bring Lila the family she’s always wanted? Or will it destroy everything she has left?"

It’s about learning what to let go of and what to fight for. When to reach out. It’s about abuse and manipulation and how hard we deny that these things have changed us. It’s about being taught that that shame is not all yours, but that you are the master of your own destiny and must own your mistakes. It’s about three steps forward and two steps back.

The house they recently sold, so his dad could move in with Melissa, so they could get a fresh start together, away from the dark memories both of their houses held. And Stiles has a new place to think of as home now, and it’s not that he doesn’t want to live there or think of it that way - he does! - it’s just, you know, an adjustment. Stiles isn’t good at changing routines, or changing the way he thinks about things when he’s not paying attention, and he’s usually not paying attention. It’s gonna be a real conscious effort to get used to thinking of Derek’s apartment as home. As his apartment too."

Hera’s walking out of the crowd to meet them. She looks flushed, she’s breathing heavily, and she’s stripped off most of her flight suit—she’s wearing only her loose white shirt and close-fitting thermal leggings.
 
Kanan, concerned, instinctively reaches out through the Force—but he senses no pain or fear from her. Quite the opposite: she’s happy, relaxed, almost joyful.

When he’s making love to Hera, Kanan finds it startlingly easy to slip into a sort of meditative trance. Time has no meaning while he’s dropping kisses down her throat, over her breasts, tracing runes with his fingers on the inside of her thighs. And he’s so attuned to her responses that the ordinary distracting chatter of his own surface thoughts slides away. All his senses are opened to her and he’s utterly focused: it’s certainly not a meditation technique that the old Jedi Masters would have ever endorsed, but it centers and grounds him and brings his spirit into harmony.

The alliance rune means everything to Magnus. When Alec works the night patrol and Magnus is left alone in their bed, a sudden pulse of elation soothes his wracked soul. Sharing his magic with Alec, who has such a childlike whimsy for sorcery, feels more intimate than any time they spend between silk sheets. Knowing Alexander is safe and always with him — it’s more than Magnus could have ever dreamed of. A bond, something tangible keeping them tethered so they can always find their way back to each other.
 When a mission goes awry, and Alec almost perishes at the hands of a unique demon, the others start to notice something’s off about him. He heals too fast, his skin’s devoid of any wrinkles, and he still has the body of a twenty year old. He seemingly hasn’t aged a bit, and neither has Clary.

Joined after the first episode by two partners Marcel Durand (Jord Moreau) and Adrian Collias (Nikandros Cora), Roland and his team travel Europe on the trail of lost or legendary sites and objects. In its early seasons, DRiP gained a decently-sized, but not massive following on LiveJournal. All combinations of the main Roland/Marcel/Adrian trio were explored in pairs or sometimes all together, though no single preferred pairing dominated. In season 2, a new recurring character of Vik No-Last-Name (played by Damen Vasilias) was introduced, who got some fannish notice almost solely because people decided he was attractive enough to be shipped. The fact that actor Damen Vasilias was known to be openly bisexual also promoted a little further interest. Thus, a ship of Roland/Vik was born that had a small fandom following and minimal canon support. All of this would change in season 3. - In which everyone is in a show, that show has a fandom, and Damen and Laurent explode it."

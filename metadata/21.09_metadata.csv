At first there are only glimpses. Bucky’s horrified face as almost a hundred years of memories flooded back into his brain. His body hitting the cold Potomac water. A hand reaching down for him. Darkness.
 When Steve Rogers wakes up in the hospital after the fall of Project Insight, he scrambles to pick up the pieces of his life after finding out Bucky Barnes stayed at the river’s edge, waiting to be arrested for his crimes. After he brings Bucky home, it’s a fight to keep what is left of their friendship as it fluctuates through the forgotten past and the cracked present, with nothing but trauma in between. They try and hold on as it evolves into something deeper, but can they find strength in each other if they can’t find it in themselves?

But Scientia, walking unerringly towards him to make his bow, looked as pristinely immaculate as always: clothes sharp, hair carefully arranged, movements fluid and precise. Gaunt, maybe, but they all were now, after the years of rationed food and frozen fields.
 
Then he saw Scientia’s face, and faltered for just a moment, and knew that Amicitia was right. He had known Scientia at his lowest, had fought him and with him, had witnessed the fire of his desperation. But the man standing in front of him was like an abandoned building waiting for a demolition crew.

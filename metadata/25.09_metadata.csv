His body was a faultless biological machine made for breeding. His metabolism worked with great efficiency, producing the cum that daily filled his balls to almost brink capacity. If Derek spent too much time without release, he quickly started to suffer pain from the fluid congestion in his testicles, a result of the enormous amount of semen he continuously made. In Alphas, this condition was called ‘red balls.’ It initially began as a tingling sensation that evolved over time into to intense, sharp pains and aching in the affected Alpha’s scrotum. This spread eventually to his larger groin. It was a condition that inflicted much discomfort on its sufferers and, if left unattended, eventually impacted an Alpha’s daily routine."

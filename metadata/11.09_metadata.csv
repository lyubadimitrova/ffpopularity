Each of the seven were very similar yet so different. From afar, there looked to be four thick lines distributed on the inside of his left arm, and three on the inside of his right. Yet, by closer inspection, the tattoos were feathers.  The one below his hand was slightly broader than the others. The one below that, just to the right and tilted to the right was quite short. The one below that, far to the left, was in a dynamic movement. The last one, closer to the inside of his elbow, was the longest. The tattoo on his wrist on his right arm was short as well. The middle and the final were close together, yet special in their own ways. And as Taehyung stood atop a building, toes dangling from the ledge, looking at the cars and people far below him on the streets of downtown Seoul, he examined his tattoos for one last time. They were to represent his friends, of course, who had been by his side through thick and thin. But they couldn’t keep him from this. No, he was worthless now. Ever since that night, he was worth nothing. Not a thought, not a glance."
